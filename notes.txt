problems
--------
* elements with broken attributes - i had a problem at onlife.co.il which the xml did not convert to an image.
after investigation i found out that the attributes are broken. like so:
<img src="http://www.nrg.co.il/images/archive/135x87/1/675/520.jpg" alt="???????: ????" ?="" ??????="" ???="" ?????="" ?????="" ?????="" ???????"="" rel="nofollow" width="120" target="_blank">
this failed the whole process.

solution: maybe to go over all elements and see that they don't have attributes with "  or ' in thie attribute value.

* body real height - when trying to get the body in onlife i found out that the image is cropped to the site of the window.
after some investigating it turns out that the body has style of height:100% so it gets the height of the window.

solution: maybe check the scrollHeight in case the root element has height:100% and dosn't have overflow-y: hidden;
